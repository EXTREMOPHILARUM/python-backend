## What is Flask?

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is termed "micro" because it does not require particular tools or libraries, giving developers the flexibility to choose their tools and components. Unlike some other Python frameworks, Flask provides the essentials to get an application up and running but leaves the rest (like form validation, database abstraction, etc.) to the developer or third-party libraries.

## Why Use Flask?

1. **Simplicity and Flexibility:** Flask's minimalistic approach allows developers to build applications their way without imposing a specific structure or tools.
2. **Extensive Documentation:** Flask boasts well-documented resources, making it beginner-friendly.
3. **Extensible:** Though Flask is minimal at its core, it's designed to be extended with various extensions available for form handling, database integration, authentication, and more.
4. **Scalable:** From a small single-page application to a large-scale project, Flask can handle it all.
5. **Community:** Flask has a strong community that contributes to its ecosystem and provides support through forums and online communities.

## MVC Architecture and Flask

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. It's a design pattern used in web development to separate an application's data, user interface, and control flow into three interconnected components:

- **Model:** Represents the application's data structures and business logic. In the context of Flask, this would often be where database interactions occur.
- **View:** This is what the user interacts with. It represents the UI of the application. In Flask, views are usually rendered using templates (with Jinja2 being the default templating engine).
- **Controller:** Acts as an interface between the Model and View. It takes user input from the view and processes it (with potential updates to the model) and returns the display output. In Flask, the routes you define act as controllers.

Flask, being a micro-framework, doesn't enforce MVC strictly, but its design is conducive to this pattern, and developers can structure their applications in an MVC fashion if they choose.

## Setting up the Environment

To get started with Flask, one needs to set up the appropriate environment:

1. **Python Installation:** Ensure you have Python installed. Flask supports Python 3.6 and newer.

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

2. **Virtual Environment:** It's a best practice to create a virtual environment for your project to manage dependencies.

    ```bash
    python -m venv flask_env
    source flask_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use: flask_env\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install Flask:** Once inside the virtual environment, install Flask using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

With the environment set up, you're ready to start developing with Flask!
